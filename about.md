I am Ketsia Dusenge. Originally from Rwanda. I am currently a computer science major at Hendrix college. I am a tech enthusiast willing to learn and collaborate with others to understand, innovate and create fun stuff. This is my Second project for my database and websystems class. I am learning how to style and link different webpages to form a visually pleasing and great functioning website.
