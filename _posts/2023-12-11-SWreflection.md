I started working on this project late September. At first I was very confused on what we were supposed to create since everything was not clear at first. Our first client meeting clarified what the Non-profit organization we were going to work with does. Family Promise of Pulaski County helps people that are experiencing Homelessness or different financial issues. Their solution is very much needed and important in the community since there are a lot of people in need of different resources that they cannot access or do not even know they are there. Having an organization that is going to connect these people with resources and referrals that would make their lives better was a great way to serve the community.

At first my role was to work on the Frontend of the creating on the Database and web application for our project. My role was to create different widgets and connect objects to the user interface to enhance user experience. However, as we got more instructions and guidance on what the client wants from the project, I had to shift my focus on working on the Backend with my other teammate since the work to be done was increasing real fast.

I started working on creating models. The two Models I created include the Resource and Referral Models that I linked to the Resource and Referral pages on the user interface. In creating these pages and Models, I used the knowledge I got from the previous labs that we had worked on for class. These labs gave me a good understanding of the how and what I need to create models and how to link them to pages.

My next task was creating a relationship between Referrals and the client entity. This was crucial to the project as the user needs to be able to choose a certain referral for their client after recording all their information. This part challenged me because our project had become more complex with the client information page that had a lot linked to it. I was able to use the knowldge I got from class and previous assignments we had to be able to link all informations on the referral page on the client page.

I took on another task of including identity and security to the project. Our client wanted to be able to have a few emails allowed to access the web applications. I used the tutorial provided by the professor to understand how to include identity in our application. I did my own research to understand how to add restrictions/authorization to only people with accounts in the website. Besides this, I also worked on creating the production database using Azure remote hosting. This was a great way for me to learn about virtual databases and how they work as well as how they can be used in our project and how good they are.


Working on this project was agreat opportunity for me to serve my community using the skills I got from class to create a solution that is going to make the services better. This gave me a good understanding of how technology can impact a lot of people and how great it can change people's lives.
