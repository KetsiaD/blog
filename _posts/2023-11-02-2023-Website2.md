title: Website creation with Multiple table
author: Ketsia Dusenge

While creating this website, the first part of creating the page with just one table was easy because it was basically the same steps as I followed while doing the first website. The tutorial to create thw second website started to be a little bit more confusing when I got to the point of now creating different pages for tables and syncing everything together following the database schema of the tutorial. Howver, this was a great time for me to understand how creating multiple table works, as I am syncing all the data and matching the database schema of the tutorial. Another interesting part I saw was the last part of adding concurrency. This was an intuitive step. I did not think about it at first when I was creating the pages, but I realized, it was an important step that I was not taking into consideraiton.

I would say, I feel ready to start working on the client's website, because this tutorial plus the edits, the professor suggested to input, helped me understand how to create a website with different tables in the database.
