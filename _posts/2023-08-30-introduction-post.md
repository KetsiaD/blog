## Chellenges working with setting up jekyll

Creating my first blog has been challenging so far especially
with the installations of all the different libraries and softwares
to help me preview my blog before I can push it to my Github to be
live for all the viewers. Regardless of all the challenging paths to get to 
this, I was able to find great guidance from [Jekyll setup guide](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home).

I am looking forward to a better understanding of all the
different pieces put together to create a blog and how to
edit and design blogs. The [Database and Websystems](https://hendrix-cs.github.io/csci340/) class's lectures
will be a great time for me t understand all the concepts.


#### There are a couple things that I still need to understand:
- All the different files in the project and what they contribute
- How Markdown is translated to HTML
- Codes in different files and how/where to alter them.
