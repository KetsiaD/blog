title: Website Creation with one table

This proess was a little bit confusing on the first steps with different pre-requisites I needed. I encountered alot of compilation errors at the start, but I managed to fix them as I tried to better undertand what is being done at each step. Other steps were pretty straight forward with creating the website from one table and making sure I sync the changes in the database with data entry.

I would say, using Jekyll for static sites and using the Razor pages for dynamic sites is the very first difference I would mention. RazorPages allowed me to change the page contents easily by changing the correnponding fields and files. However, Both provide a good layout pages. 

One of the most challenging part While creating my site with Razor Pages, was migrating the changes I made to the database in my files to the actual database file to make sure the seeded data is displayed when I ran the application. The actual process was not hard, but I would miss this part many times, which would take me a while to figure out why my added fields or changes are not showing when I ran the application. With the challenges and lessons learnt along the way, I feel even more confident to create another Razor Application.
