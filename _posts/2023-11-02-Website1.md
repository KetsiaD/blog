title: Website Creation with one table
author: Ketsia Dusenge

This proess was a little bit confusing on the first steps with different pre-requisites I needed. I encountered alot of compilation errors at the start, but I managed to fix them as I tried to better undertand what is being done at each step. Other steps were pretty straight forward with creating the website from one table and making sure I sync the changes in the database with data entry.

I would say, using Jekyll for static sites and using the Razor pages for dynamic sites is the very first difference I would mention.
