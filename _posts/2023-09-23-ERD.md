In this post I am going to discuss how I cam eup with an ERD for an online shopping kind of entity with items for sale,customer, order item and order relationships


The first table is the Customer table that will have customer account information with the ID of the customer as the primary key since different customers should have unique ids that will be associated with their order. This table will be linked to order table since customers will be the ones to add orders and the orders table need to have the unique ID of the customer associated with the order.

The next table I came up with is one for Items for sale. These items will be added by the store owner and they will have different attributes that will explain their properties including it's name, quantity, manufacturer price, quantity... The name of this item is the Primary key and this name is the same name of the order item, if selected by customer. Different order items will make up the order table which the customer will be checking out. The order table will contain an ID of the order and different conditions of when it should be deliverd or picked up.

As mentioned, the order should have the unique Identifier of the customer associated as foreign key. The order Item's name should also be part of the order as a foreign key as this is needed to know what items are part of the order. The order item should contain the items for sale name as a foreign key and primar key since the name of the order item is techniquely the item for sale that was selected by the customer.

### Below are the different visual demostrations of the relationships between these different entities.
