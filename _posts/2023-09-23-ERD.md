In this post I am going to discuss how I cam eup with an ERD for an online shopping kind of entity with store owner,sale items, order, and customer relationship.

The first main point I considered was the relationship between store owner and customer. This is because the process of shopping can not start without store owner putting in items to shop and there would be no shopping if customer is not buying the items.

This bring me to my  first table, the store owner table. I gave it the name and Id becuase the store owner will have a name and a unique ID that will identify them from other store owner. I considered this to be a common online market where different store owners can have different accounts.

The next table is the Customer table that will have customer account information with the ID of the customer as the primary key since different customers should have unique ids that will be associated with their order.
