title: Creation of Production SQL Database
author: Ketsia Dusenge

During the final project, I worked on the creation of the Production Database with Azure. It was challenging at first to understand different parts of Azure platform as there was alot to learn and navigate. After being familiar with the platform, the next part that challenged me a little bit was getting the right account to be able to access different resources without payment. I was able to use a student account which gave me an opportunity to use different resources and services of Azure as well as the SQL database. Everything after the set up was pretty much straight forward, as I was able to follow the tutorial we had to create the database and continue with deployment. This lab helped me and my teammeates work together as we ended up using one laptop to work on the lab since there were alot of conflicts with the different base codes we had on different laptops. Working on this lab gave me an opportunity to understand how remote databases work as well as how the Azure remote hosting plartform works which was crucial in getting our application deployed.
