This Assignment has been challenging especially when it came to understanding all the different pieces in the files and how they all interconnect to bring about the visual changes we see. 

Besides all the challenges ans confusions at some point. I was able to figure out where files are located and different way they are all connecting to each other. This has been a great way for me to understand all the behind the scene work that is going on to bring about the visual changes to the end user.
