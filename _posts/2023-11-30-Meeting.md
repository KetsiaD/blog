After the second client meeting, we had a better picture of what our client wants the project ot be. This was thanks to the moqups we had that gave the client a clear image of what we are thinking of doing with the project. From there we had a lot of changes as the client explained what entities they would want to see related and what screens they need and don't need.

After the second meeting, I worked more on the backend of the project. This mainly because we had a lot of changes to make to our models and database that needed more people to work on it. I shifted my focus on creating Models, link Models that we had and creating security/identity since our application was to be used by only admins and not available for the general public. This was a challenging and educational experience as I was able to improove my knowldge in understanding better how to link models and the best way to do it as we had learnt in class.
